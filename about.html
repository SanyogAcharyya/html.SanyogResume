<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Sanyog Acharyya — a passionate and driven tech enthusiast working toward becoming a Full Stack Developer in India. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from SRM Institute, Chennai (2020), and since then, my journey has been a blend of hands-on industry experience, continuous learning, and a genuine desire to solve real-world problems through technology.</p>

<p>I began my professional career at Amazon as a Customer Service Representative, where I developed strong communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and an understanding of user-first thinking. Later, I worked at Cognizant as a Junior Software Engineer for two years, gaining exposure to corporate software development, teamwork, and scalable systems.</p>

<p>Over time, I discovered that my true calling lies in building products end-to-end. That’s why I’m currently focused on mastering Full Stack Development—from clean and efficient front-end interfaces to robust back-end logic.</p>

  <li>Strengthening my web development foundation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).</li>
  <li>Learning modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and Node.js.</li>
  <li>Building real-world projects to sharpen my development skills</li>
  <li>Expanding my knowledge in databases, APIs, and cloud services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Values</h2>
<p>I believe in:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Consistency over perfection.</b></li>
  <li><b>Helping others</b> sharing knowledge, and always staying humble.</li>
  <li><b>Learning continuously—</b> because tech evolves every day, and so should we.</li>
</ul>
<h2> My Goal</h2>
<p>To become a skilled, job-ready <b>Full Stack Developer</b>, create meaningful digital experiences, and secure a strong tech role in India’s fast-growing software industry.</p>
